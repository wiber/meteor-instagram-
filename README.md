Instagram OAuth flow, dependency to accounts-instagram-

Since the refactoring of oauth in Meteor v0.6.4 two packages are used for oauth services. The first is named as the service, eg facebook, and the other is named eg accounts-facebook.

To stay as close as possible to the meteor this packages is adaptedand renamed to 'instagram-' and a dependency to 'accounts-instagram-'.

Many thanks to Yossi Motro for the original and very excellent meteor-accounts-instagram.
